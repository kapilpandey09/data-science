    "A database is a structured collection of data that is electronically stored and organized in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation.  Think of it as a giant filing cabinet for information, but instead of folders and papers, you have tables, rows, and columns to organize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language):  SQL databases are relational, meaning they follow a strict schema. Data is organized into fixed tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined. This makes SQL good for well-defined, structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL):  NoSQL databases are non-relational. They offer more flexibility in data structure. Data can be stored in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. This makes NoSQL a good choice for unstructured or constantly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL:  SQL databases typically scale vertically, meaning you upgrade the existing server to handle more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL:  NoSQL databases are known for horizontal scaling. You can add more commodity servers to the network to distribute the workload and increase capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL:  SQL uses a standardized query language (SQL) for accessing and manipulating data. This makes it easy to perform complex queries across multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL:  NoSQL databases have varying query languages specific to each type of database. Some NoSQL databases may not even use a query language at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL:  SQL databases are ideal for transaction-heavy applications, legacy systems, and data requiring complex queries with joins. For example, an e-commerce platform with user accounts, product data, and order history would likely benefit from an SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL:  NoSQL databases shine when dealing with big data, large amounts of unstructured data (like social media posts or sensor readings), or data that needs to be highly available and scalable. For example, a social networking application with a rapidly growing user base and constantly updating feeds might leverage a NoSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific needs of your application.  If you have structured data with complex relationships and need to perform intricate queries,  SQL might be the way to go. If you have big data,  unstructured data, or require high scalability and flexibility, NoSQL could be a better fit."

    "A primary key is a column (or set of columns) within a table that uniquely identifies each row of data. It acts as the main identifier for a record, similar to a social security number uniquely identifying a person.\n",
    "A table can only have one primary key.\n",
    "The values in a primary key column must be unique and not null (cannot be empty). This ensures no duplicate records exist in the table.\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",

    "A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that references the primary key of another table. It creates a link between the two tables, establishing a relationship between the data they contain.\n",
    "A table can have one or more foreign keys, referencing different tables.\n",
    "The values in a foreign key column must either match an existing value in the referenced primary key table or be null. This enforces data consistency and prevents orphaned data (data in the child table that doesn't correspond to any valid record in the parent table).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a database for a library. You might have two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Books: This table stores information about books, with columns like book_id (primary key), title, author, and genre.\n",
    "Borrowers: This table stores information about borrowers, with columns like borrower_id (primary key), name, phone_number, and email.\n",
    "To link these tables and track which books are borrowed by whom, you could add a foreign key column named borrowed_book_id to the Borrowers table. This borrowed_book_id would reference the book_id primary key in the Books table.\n",
