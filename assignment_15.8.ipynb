    "Grid Search CV, short for Grid Search Cross-Validation, is a powerful technique used to find the optimal values for a model's hyperparameters. It automates the process of trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values and evaluating their performance on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a grid: You tell Grid Search CV which hyperparameters you want to tune and specify a range of possible values for each one. This creates a \"grid\" of all possible combinations.\n",

    "It trains the model with a different combination of hyperparameter values from the grid.\n",

    "It evaluates the model's performance using a chosen metric (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: Grid Search CV averages the performance scores across all folds for each hyperparameter combination. This helps to account for randomness and overfitting.\n",
