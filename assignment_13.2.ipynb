    "\n",
    "Overfitting is an undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data but not for new data. When data scientists use machine learning models for making predictions, they first train the model on a known data set. Then, based on this information, the model tries to predict outcomes for new data sets. An overfit model can give inaccurate predictions and cannot perform well for all types of new data."

    "Underfitting vs. overfitting\n",
    "Underfit models experience high bias—they give inaccurate results for both the training data and test set. On the other hand, overfit models experience high variance—they give accurate results for the training set but not for the test set. More model training results in less bias but variance can increase. Data scientists aim to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting when fitting a model. A well-fitted model can quickly establish the dominant trend for seen and unseen data sets."
