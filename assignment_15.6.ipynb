    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two distinct approaches to hosting and managing websites and applications. Here are the key differences between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure Ownership:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: In traditional hosting, businesses typically own or lease physical servers that are dedicated to hosting their websites or applications. These servers are usually housed in data centers.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting utilizes virtualized infrastructure provided by cloud service providers. Instead of owning physical servers, users rent virtual resources (such as virtual machines) from the cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Scaling in traditional hosting often involves acquiring and configuring additional physical hardware. This process can be time-consuming and may require downtime.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting offers on-demand scalability. Users can easily scale their resources up or down based on changing requirements. This elasticity allows for quick adjustments to handle varying levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Resources in traditional hosting (such as CPU, RAM, and storage) are usually fixed and allocated to specific servers. If a server reaches its capacity, additional resources may need to be added manually.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting provides dynamic resource allocation. Resources can be provisioned and de-provisioned automatically based on demand. Users pay for the resources they use, promoting cost efficiency.\n",
